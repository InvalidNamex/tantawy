# Agent custom login logic.
1. add password field in table agents.
2. create custom login logic dedicated for agents only, as they will login via api using a mobile app and I don't want them to have users in auth_users. The reason behind that is that I will have different criteria and I don't want to conflict with auth_user django rules.
3. adjust models, etc.. for agents create post requests for login in the api

## ‚úÖ **AGENT AUTHENTICATION IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**
Successfully implemented complete agent custom authentication system:
- **Agent Model Restructure**: Removed dependency on auth_user table, added independent authentication fields
- **Password Security**: Implemented secure password hashing and verification
- **API Endpoints**: Created three authentication endpoints for mobile app integration
- **Database Migration**: Clean migration from old to new agent structure
- **Admin Interface**: Updated with proper password management forms
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All authentication flows tested and verified working
- **Mobile Ready**: System ready for mobile app integration with token-based authentication

Updates on Agents:
adjust the table to include only the following fields, removing all other fields.
id, createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt, createdBy, updatedBy, deletedBy, isDeleted, isActive, agentName, agentUsername, agentPassword, agentPhone.

Follow up:
1- add agentID in invoiceMaster to know if the invoice was made by an agent.
2- add sales invoice and return sales to this screen http://127.0.0.1:8000/agents/manage/3/
3- rename ŸÇÿ≥ÿßÿ¶ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÖÿå ŸÇÿ≥ÿßÿ¶ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿØŸÅÿπ to be ÿ≥ŸÜÿØ ŸÇÿ®ÿ∂ and ÿ≥ŸÜÿØ ÿßŸÑÿØŸÅÿπ
4- remove ÿßÿ¨ŸÖÿßŸÑŸä ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ≥ÿßÿ¶ŸÖ -ŸÖÿπÿßŸÖŸÑÿßÿ™ Ÿáÿ∞ÿß ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ®Ÿàÿπ


AGENT/STORE todo:
1- create a storeID field in the agents table that is "storeID" not storeID_id
2- in "http://127.0.0.1:8000/agents/manage/create/" add a dropdown menu that is searchable that lists stores so the user can select a store to bind it to an agent.
3- similar to step 2 in "http://127.0.0.1:8000/agents/manage/5/edit/"
add the dropdown menu searchable to change the store bound to an agent.
4- in agent view "http://127.0.0.1:8000/agents/manage/5/"
add the store that is bound to the agent in the section that has his username, id, etc..
